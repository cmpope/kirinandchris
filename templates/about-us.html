            <h3><span class="text-muted"><em>Told by the Bride</em></span></h3>
            <p class="lead">Chris and I lived on the 3rd floor of the same dorm building our freshman year at Loyola Marymount, but didn’t actually meet until our junior year when my friend Kit and I attended a party at his house.</p>
            <p class="lead">We ran into each other again at a bar a few months later and exchanged numbers. He invited me over to his house to watch Orange County the next week. When I arrived, Chris’ roommate (and now groomsman), Joe Gutto, opened the door and we waited in the foyer for a few minutes until Chris made his grand entrance down the staircase…just like in the movies.</p>
            <p class="lead">That summer, Chris and Joe moved into an apartment across the street from the house I shared with friends (including my bridesmaid, Kelly Clements) and we continued to spend time together.</p>
            <p class="lead">My relationship with Chris and our happiness have obviously grown since then, but that summer still feels electric and remains one of the best times of my life. I am incredibly grateful to Chris, our <a href="/the-wedding-party">wedding party</a> and our wedding attendants for making that period of our lives so special.</p>

            <p class="lead">We live in Downtown Burlingame, which is about 15 miles south of San Francisco. We’ve been in our apartment for over 2 years and love spending time shopping and eating in our neighborhood. We are often out and about, but are both homebodies at heart.</p>
            <p class="lead">The weekly routines that make us happiest are cooking dinner together on Monday nights (referred to as “Pasta Monday” in our household), curling up on the couch after work with Netflix (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com">start your free trial here</a>) with a good beer, and hanging out at a bar called the Garrett after Chris’ Sunday night hockey games.</p>
