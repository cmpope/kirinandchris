            <h3><span class="text-muted"><em>Told by the Bride</em></span></h3>
            <p class="lead">Chris and I lived on the 3rd floor of the same dorm building our freshman year at Loyola Marymount, but didn’t actually meet until our junior year when my friend Kit and I attended a party at his house.</p>
            <p class="lead">We ran into each other again at a bar a few months later and exchanged numbers. He invited me over to his house to watch Orange County the next week. When I arrived, Chris’ roommate (and now groomsman), Joe, opened the door and we waited in the foyer for a few minutes until Chris made his grand entrance down the staircase…just like in the movies.</p>
            <p class="lead">That summer, Chris and Joe moved into an apartment across the street from the house I shared with friends (including my bridesmaid, Kelly) and we continued to spend time together.</p>
            <p class="lead">My relationship with Chris and our happiness have obviously grown since then, but that summer still feels electric and remains one of the best times of my life. I am incredibly grateful to Chris, our <a href="/the-wedding-party">wedding party</a> and our wedding guests for making that period of our lives so special.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Life Together</h2>
            <p class="lead">We live in Downtown Burlingame, which is about 15 miles south of San Francisco. We’ve been in our apartment for over 2 years and love spending time shopping and eating in our neighborhood. We are often out and about, but are both homebodies at heart.</p>
            <p class="lead">The weekly routines that make us happiest are cooking dinner together on Monday nights (referred to as “Pasta Monday” in our household), curling up on the couch after work with Netflix (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com">start your free trial here</a>) and a good beer, and hanging out at a bar called the Garrett after Chris’ Sunday night hockey games.</p>

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="contact">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="static/the-engagment.JPG" alt="Kirin-Mysorewala-and-Chris-Pope's-engagement">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Engagement</h2>
            <h3><span class="text-muted"><em>Told by the Groom</em></span></h3>
            <p class="lead">Step one: ask her Father for permission. The Mysorewala family vacation in Sonoma this past summer was the perfect setting to pop the pops question. Nightly walks were popular and one night Kirin decided to stay behind so Amin (Kirin’s father), Sharif (Kirin’s Grandfather) and I went on a walk. I waited until we had almost returned to the house to ask Amin if he “had a minute to talk.” I was nervous but managed to get the words out and he couldn’t have been happier.</p>
            <p class="lead">Step two: get the ring. After Googling “how to buy a wedding ring,” and analyzing the ‘4 C’s’ of a diamond, I decided to reach out to my life consultants Mike and Vicki Pope for guidance. My mom recommended a jeweler in Saratoga close to Apple’s headquarters called Vardy’s European Jewelers. Misha is the son of Vardy, the owner, and kindly waited 30 minutes past closing time on a Wednesday for me to fight traffic on the way from work. The only other time I have seen a ‘loop’ is in famous burglary movies, but next thing I knew I’m holding this awkward magnifying glass trying to comprehend “the pop and shine” as it is being described to me. Luckily, Vicki has been going to Vardy’s for years and I never felt pressured or schemed so after a few recommendations I had made my choice. One interesting recommendation Misha had was to go with a plain setting for the proposal and then come back in with Kirin so she could choose the final setting. This worried me at first because I thought it would take away from the ‘wow factor’ but as you’ll see in step three, that was not an issue.</p>
            <p class="lead">Step three: pop the question. Katie (my sister) tells the story of my original idea much better than I do, so I had to think of an idea that did not involve a website where she clicked “Yes or No” to the biggest question of my life. Plan B used the incredible location of Kirin’s work as the setting for the kneel and draw. Williams Sonoma’s headquarters are located on beautiful San Francisco bay next to the famous Ghirardelli Square. So the plan was to have friends email a dinner invitation for Friday night a few days prior. I then casually suggested that I could meet her for drinks near her office before dinner. McCormick and Kuleto’s is a great seafood restaurant located in Ghirardelli Square with beautiful views of San Francisco Bay. I called and reserved a private room at the restaurant where we would meet our families after the proposal. The plan was set and the day of Katie (the undercover photographer) and I headed towards ground zero. The only problem was I didn’t have time to really scout out the area outside her office where I would propose. So when Kaite and I arrived we scrambled to come up with where I would propose and where she would hide. There is a small grass area on the way down to the bay from her office and that seemed like the best spot. I originally planned on having flowers for her when i met her but traffic was bad on the way into the city and this ended up working out for the better. When I met her outside the office I was wearing a button-down shirt with a sport coat and nice jeans. I think she was a little suspicious why I was dressed so nice but the flowers would have been a dead give away. So still clueless on what was about to happen we walked down the sidewalk <a href="https://goo.gl/lHaqgk" target="_blank">towards the water and grass area</a>. When we were next to the grass area I nudged her to the right on to the grass, she asked what I was doing, I took a few more steps, turned to face her, grabbed both her arms tight and said a few words ending with a kneel and “will you marry me?” </p>
